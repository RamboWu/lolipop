lolipop
============

A forum written by flask

Lolipop is a simplification of [june](https://github.com/pythoncn/june) and may more easier to understanding.

You could visit my example [site](http://forum.kochiya.me) (maybe sometimes I would let it offline, in that case , you could PM me)

Be careful.This project is under developing,I could not guarantee it would run well.
